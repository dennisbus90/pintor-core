## Expanding Pintor

Currently, one preview component is available:

- PinTable - A flexible, animated table component that uses Motion [Motion](https://https://motion.dev/) for smooth and complex animations.

### Future to come

As Pintor evolves, more complex components are on the way. Expect new additions and improvements to existing ones as the library grows.

Upcoming components and utilities:

- PinGrid (Utility) â€” A simple, flexible way to implement grid systems in your projects â€” built to integrate seamlessly with Pintor components.
- PinDateDiagram (Component) â€” An interactive, selectable date diagram powered by [D3](https://https://d3js.org/). perfect for visualizing date ranges and timelines.
- PinList [Component] â€” A highly customizable list component â€” minimal by default, but easily extensible.
